# SBA_Small_Loan_Analysis


The purpose of this analysis is to find out what are the significant factors that lead to default in the state of Illinois. We use the SBA Loans dataset to find out those factors. In this report, we focus on seven predictors that we think are significant to predict the loan status. We use descriptive statistics, data visualization, and logistic regression to get a brief idea about the related factors.
